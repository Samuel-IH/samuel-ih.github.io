Hi, I'm Sam! I'm a passionate (and slightly crazed) programmer and game developer with a love for interactive experiences and pushing myself and my code to the limit.

I started coding at the early age of 8 and have been hooked ever since. I see every project as a puzzle -- a challenge to be solved. I love the evolution of technology and the new challenges it brings. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my code and my skills.

This site is a collection of my projects, both personal and professional. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!

Should you need to contact me, I can be found on the interwebz at the following locations:
