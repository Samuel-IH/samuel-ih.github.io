_Corn_ was a 2-day mini-game project that I made to help learn unity's navigation system. It had a simple rpg-like click-to-navigate interface with edge screen turning. The goal was to safeguard your garden from the evil crows that were trying to eat your corn. Your countermeasure? A giant hammer.

Mechanics:
* Left-click on the ground to move there.
* Right-click on a crow to hit it with your hammer.
* Move your mouse/hammer to the edges of the screen to rotate your view.
* Crow makes a squawk sound when it's hit.

What I learned:
* How to use Unity's navigation system (NavMesh). This included:
  * How to bake a NavMesh.
  * How to use NavMeshAgents.
  * How to use NavMeshObstacles.
* Basics in terrain-painting.
